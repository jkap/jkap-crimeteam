# projects i've done (mostly open source (if they're software))

## speedrunning Disneyland

i had the dumb idea to try and [speedrun Disneyland](https://blog.jkap.io/2018/01/29/the-dumbest-idea-ive-ever-had-speedrunning-disneyland/) and some people [decided they cared](https://twitter.com/jkap/status/958188434576760833). [USgamer wrote about it](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/meet-the-person-who-is-speedrunning-disneyland). i attempted it on 2018-02-11 and succeeded in under 13 and a half hours. [i wrote a trip report on my blog](https://blog.jkap.io/2018/02/14/dldq2018-post-mortem-i-cant-believe-i-actually-did-it/). [digg wrote about it too](https://digg.com/2018/disneyland-speedrun).
